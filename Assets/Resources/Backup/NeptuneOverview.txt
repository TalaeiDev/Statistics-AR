Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant called Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far away from the sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system that is not visible to the naked eye. Its existence was first predicted by mathematitians long before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.  NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune from a short distance. It flew past Neptue in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.
