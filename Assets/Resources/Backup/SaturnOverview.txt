Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second most massive planet in the solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings made of chunks of ice and rock but no other planet's rings are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's rings.  Like its fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive gas ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
