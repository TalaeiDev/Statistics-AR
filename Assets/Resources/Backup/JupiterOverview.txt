Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moon beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth, in line from the Sun, Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It's more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.  Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiters iconic Great red spot is a giant storm. It's larger than Earth, and it has raged for hundreds of years.  NASA's Juno orbiter spacecraft is currently exploring this giant world.
