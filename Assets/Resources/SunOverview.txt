The Sun is a star. There are lots of stars, but the Sun is the closest one to Earth. It is the center of our solar system.

The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. It keeps our planet warm enough for living things to thrive. It gives us light so we can see.

Eight planets move around the Sun. We call that an orbit. The planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Lots of smaller worlds orbit the Sun. Pluto is a dwarf planet beyond Neptune. There are many asteroids and comets that go around the Sun, too.
